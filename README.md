# The Murk

**The Murk** is a horror-themed Fabric mod for Minecraft 1.20.1 that transforms darkness into a deadly threat. Venture into the shadows unprepared, and face the chilling consequences of *Murk's Grasp*, a debuff that creeps up in low light levels, bringing fear and danger to your world.

## Features

- **Murk's Grasp Effect**: 
  - Triggers in low light levels (default: below 3) after 15 seconds of darkness, with a warning message at 5 seconds.
  - Applies a harmful status effect with a dark purple hue, slowing movement by 15% and dealing scaling damage (0.5 to 2.0 hearts every 5 seconds by default) if you linger in the dark.
  - Persists for a configurable duration (default: 4 seconds) after entering a lit area, with optional Blindness effect (Added by default).

- **Dynamic Light Detection**:
  - Supports held items, dropped items, trinket slots (via Trinkets), and nearby playersâ€™ light sources to reset the darkness timer.
  - Configurable light sources (e.g., torches, lanterns, glowstone) with customizable luminance and water sensitivity.
  - Integrates with **LambDynamicLights** for realistic light checks, requiring line-of-sight to light-emitting items.

- **Configurable Gameplay**:
  - Customize light thresholds, dimensions (e.g., Overworld, Nether), and effect behaviors via `config/murk.json5`.
  - Options to enable/disable underwater light checks, Creative mode effects, and warning messages.

- **NOTES**:
  - Inspired by mods like *OminousDarkness* and *Grue* but built for Fabric.

## Dependencies

- **Required**: Fabric API, Cloth Config, Lodestone
- **Optional**: Trinkets, LambDynamicLights, Sodium Dynamic Lights (partial), ModMenu

## Configuration

Edit `config/murk.json5` to tweak:
- Light threshold (0-15)
- Dimensions where the effect applies (e.g., `minecraft:overworld`, `minecraft:the_nether`)
- Effect duration after finding a light source, damage, and Blindness toggle
- Light source properties and detection radius
- For **LambDynamicLights** integration, ensure each light-emitting item has a corresponding JSON file in `assets/murk/dynamiclights/item/` and `data/murk/dynamiclights/item/` (e.g., `torch.json`, `lantern.json`). See documentation: https://lambdaurora.dev/projects/lambdynamiclights/docs/v4/item.html
- for **Sodium Dynamic Lights** see file example in the mods asset folder in sodiums dynamic lights jar file `dynamiclights/item/` although from what i tested doesnt visually make the block or item emit light only lets my mod detect it and prevents the status effect.

Use **ModMenu** for in-game configuration with categorized settings (General, Effect, Light Source) and tooltips for clarity.
